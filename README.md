# Centralized-Smart-City-System
A revolutionary traffic management system, which will play a crucial role in the generation of clean energy. Also enhancing citizen safety as well as providing support in emergency situations

we are designing a centralised management system which will utilize a combination of various software and hardware. The Following are it’s currently planned implementations of the system.

•	**Smart Traffic Management System:** We propose a smart traffic management system which will prevent vehicles from crossing red signals. Hence considerably avoiding accidents. It consists of a easily deployable autonomous blockage system. It uses a mechanism which is somewhat similar to a scissor providing quick deployment. 

•	Traffic density-based light time adjustable system: A density based traffic light system is a tech that adjusts the duration of traffic lights on a particular road based on the density of vehicles waiting on that road at a particular instance of time. All the calculations are done real time hence greatly increasing the authenticity of the system. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to the detect the number of vehicles on that road and adjust the light duration of the green light in particular to allow more vehicles to pass through the intersection, without having more effect on the collective waiting time of vehicles.

•	Rapid emergency response system: A system designed to create a special route for the emergency vehicles to achieve minimum travel and stoppage time. The special route will be cleared as the crossing roads can be blocked for a short duration of time using out traffic management system. The unique point about this is the location of the emergency vehicle will be tracked real-time so blockage system will be activated only when the vehicle is in a radius of 300-400 meters. Hence avoiding the creation of a traffic jam.

•	Navigator: The Navigator is an application meant for the citizens of a city. It tracks the state of traffic lights, advises the optimum course of travel based on the timing of each light along the way, greatly decreasing the travel as well as stoppage time. It also provides a feature of emergency reporting which triggers the traffic management system to create a special route for the user in case of emergencies.

•	Clean energy generation: The deployable blockage system will also generate electricity in shirked state as the motor powering the system will be used as generator when vehicles pass over them. In shirked state the hardware will look somewhat similar to a speed breaker. 

•	Threat and Crime Detection: The system is capable of utilizing the video feed of cameras present in the city, provides a better surveillance and will inform the authorities in case of something suspicious.
